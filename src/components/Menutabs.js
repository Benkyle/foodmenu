        As a decrepit father takes delight To see his active child do deeds of youth, So I, made lame by Fortune's dearest spite, Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth; For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit, Or any of these all, or all, or more,
         Entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit, I make my love engrafted, 
         to this store: So then I am not lame, poor, nor despis'd, Whilst 
         that this shadow doth such substance give
    </p>
